# About
Lake Line is an app dedicated to finding hikes that put the hiker near a lake. I have often felt that a hike should be under 4 miles up, and to a lake. If you have a water filter you wont need to bring much, and you can spend most of your time enjoying a beautiful setting without too much work. This app uses the rapid-weather-api for information about your hiking location, the hiking-project for trail information, and mapquest for map results.

# Getting Started

You will also need the back end api server running. See the repo [here](https://github.com/perryr16/lake_line)
